# Nix Starter Config

This repo contains a few a simple nix flake templates for getting started with
NixOS + home-manager.

# What this provides

- [Minimal version](./minimal):
    - NixOS configuration on `nixos/configuration.nix`, accessible via
      `nixos-rebuild --flake .`
    - Home-manager configuration on `home-manager/home.nix`, accessible via
      `home-manager --flake .`
- [Standard version](./standard):
    - Basic boilerplate for adding custom packages (under `pkgs`) and overlays
      (under `overlay`). Accessible on your system, home config, as well as `nix
      build .#package-name`.
    - Boilerplate for custom NixOS (`modules/nixos`) and home-manager
      (`modules/home-manager`) modules
    - NixOS and home-manager configurations from minimal, and they should
      also use your overlays and custom packages right out of the box.

# Getting started

Assuming you have a basic NixOS booted up (either live or installed, anything
works). [Here's a link to the latest NixOS downloads, just for
you](https://nixos.org/download#download-nixos).

Alternatively, you can totally use `nix` and `home-manager` on your existing
distro (or even on Darwin). [Install nix](https://nixos.org/download.html#nix)
and follow along (just ignore the `nixos-*` commands).

## What template to chose?

If this is your first trying flakes, or you're attempting to migrate your
(simple) config to it; you should use the minimal version.

If you're here looking for inspiration/tips/good practices (and you already use
flakes), or you're migrating a config that already has overlays and custom
packages; try the standard version.

## I like your funny words, magic man

Not sure what this all means?

Take a look at [the learn hub on the NixOS
website](https://nixos.org/learn.html) (scroll down to guides, the manuals, and
the other awesome learning resources).

Learning the basics of what Nix (the package manager) is, how the Nix language
works, and a bit of NixOS basics should get you up and running. Don't worry if
it seems a little confusing at first. Get confortable with the basic concepts
and come back here to get your feet wet, it's the best way to learn!

## The repo

- [Install git](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/git), if you haven't already.
- Create a repository for your config, for example:
```bash
cd ~/Documents
git init nix-config
cd nix-config
```
- Make sure you're running Nix 2.4+, and opt into the experimental `flakes` and `nix-command` features:
```bash
# Should be 2.4+
nix --version
export NIX_CONFIG="experimental-features = nix-command flakes"
```
- Get the template:
```bash
# For minimal version
nix flake init -t github:misterio77/nix-starter-config#minimal

# For standard version
nix flake init -t github:misterio77/nix-starter-config#standard
```
- If you want to use NixOS: add stuff you currently have on `/etc/nixos/` to
  `nixos` (usually `configuration.nix` and `hardware-configuration.nix`, when
  you're starting out).
    - The included file has some options you might want, specially if you don't
      have a configuration ready. Make sure you have generated your own
      `hardware-configuration.nix`; if not, just mount your partitions to
      `/mnt` and run: `nixos-generate-config --root /mnt`.
- If you want to use home-manager: add your stuff from `~/.config/nixpkgs`
  to `home-manager` (probably `home.nix`).
  - The included file is also a good starting point if you don't have a config
    yet.
- Take a look at `flake.nix`, making sure to fill out anything marked with
  FIXME (required) or TODO (usually tips or optional stuff you might want)
- `git add` and `git push` your changes! Or at least copy them somewhere if
  you're on a live medium.

## Usage

- Run `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#hostname` to apply your system
  configuration.
    - If you're still on a live installation medium, run `nixos-install --flake
      .#hostname` instead, and reboot.
- Run `home-manager switch --flake .#username@hostname` to apply your home
  configuration.
  - If you don't have home-manager installed, try `nix shell nixpkgs#home-manager`.

And that's it, really! You're ready to have fun with your configurations using
the latest and greatest nix3 flake-enabled command UX.

# What next?

## Multiple nixpkgs channels

`multi-nixpkgs` shows how to setup multiple nixpkgs channels. For example, using the stable channel you can add the unstable version of neovim like:

```
home.packages = with pkgs; [
  unstable.neovim
];
```

## Adding more hosts or users

You can organize them by hostname and username on `nixos` and `home-manager`
directories, be sure to also add them to `flake.nix`.

You can take a look at my (beware, here be reproductible dragons)
[configuration repo](https://github.com/misterio77/nix-config) for ideas.

NixOS makes it easy to share common configuration between hosts (you might want
to create a common directory for these), while keeping everything in sync.
home-manager can help you sync your environment (from editor to WM and
everything in between) anywhere you use it. Have fun!

## User password and secrets

You have basically two ways of setting up default passwords:
- By default, you'll be prompted for a root password when installing with
  `nixos-install`. After you reboot, be sure to add a password to your own
  account and lock root using `sudo passwd -l root`.
- Alternatively, you can specify `initialPassword` for your user. This will
  give your account a default password, be sure to change it after rebooting!
  If you do, you should pass `--no-root-passwd` to `nixos-install`, to skip
  setting a password on the root account.

If you don't want to set your password imperatively, you can also use
`passwordFile` for safely and declaratively setting a password from a file
outside the nix store.

There's also [more advanced options for secret
management](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Comparison_of_secret_managing_schemes),
including some that can include them (encrypted) into your config repo and/or
nix store, be sure to check them out if you're interested.

## Dotfile management with home-manager

Besides just adding packages to your environment, home-manager can also manage
your dotfiles. I strongly recommend you do, it's awesome!

For full nix goodness, check out the home-manager options with `man
home-configuration.nix`. Using them, you'll be able to fully configure any
program with nix syntax and its powerful abstractions.

Alternatively, if you're still not ready to rewrite all your configs to nix
syntax, there's home-manager options (such as `xdg.configFile`) for including
files from your config repository into your usual dot directories. Add your
existing dotfiles to this repo and try it out!

## Try opt-in persistance

You might have noticed that there's impurity in your NixOS system, in the form
of configuration files and other cruft your system generates when running. What
if you change them in a whim to get something working and forget about it?
Boom, your system is not fully reproductible anymore.

You can instead fully delete your `/` and `/home` on every boot! Nix is okay
with a empty root on boot (all you need is `/boot` and `/nix`), and will
happily reapply your configurations.

There's two main approaches to this: mount a `tmpfs` (RAM disk) to `/`, or
(using a filesystem such as btrfs or zfs) mount a blank snapshot and reset it
on boot.

For stuff that can't be managed through nix (such as games downloaded from
steam, or logs), use [impermanence](https://github.com/nix-community/impermanence)
for mounting stuff you to keep to a separate partition/volume (such as
`/nix/persist` or `/persist`). This makes everything vanish by default, and you
can keep track of what you specifically asked to be kept.

Here's some awesome blog posts about it:
- [Erase your darlings](https://grahamc.com/blog/erase-your-darlings)
- [Encrypted BTRFS with Opt-In State on
  NixOS](https://mt-caret.github.io/blog/posts/2020-06-29-optin-state.html)
- [NixOS: tmpfs as root](https://elis.nu/blog/2020/05/nixos-tmpfs-as-root/) and
  [tmpfs as home](https://elis.nu/blog/2020/06/nixos-tmpfs-as-home/)

## Adding custom packages

Something you want to use that's not in nixpkgs yet? You can easily build and
iterate on a derivation (package) from this very repository.

Create a folder with the desired name inside `pkgs`, and add a `default.nix`
file containing a derivation. Be sure to also `callPackage` them on
`pkgs/default.nix`.

You'll be able to refer to that package from anywhere on your
home-manager/nixos configurations, build them with `nix build .#package-name`,
or bring them into your shell with `nix shell .#package-name`.

See [the manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixpkgs/stable/) for some tips on how
to package stuff.

## Adding overlays

Found some outdated package on nixpkgs you need the latest version of? Perhaps
you want to apply a patch to fix a behaviour you don't like? Nix makes it easy
and manageble with overlays!

Use the `overlays/default.nix` file for this.

If you're creating patches, you can keep them on the `overlays` folder as well.

See [the wiki article](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Overlays) to see how it all
works.

## Adding your own modules

Got some configurations you want to create an abstraction of? Modules are the
answer. These awesome files can expose _options_ and implement _configurations_
based on how the options are set.

Create a file for them on either `modules/nixos` or `modules/home-manager`. Be
sure to also add them to the listing at `modules/nixos/default.nix` or
`modules/home-manager/default.nix`.

See [the wiki article](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Module) to learn more about
them.

# Troubleshooting / FAQ

Please [let me know](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-config/issues)
any questions or issues you face with these templates, so I can add more info
here!

## Nix says my repo files don't exist, even though they do!

Nix flakes only see files that git is currently tracked, so just `git add .`
and you should be good to go. Files on `.gitignore`, of course, are invisible
to nix - this is to guarantee your build won't depend on anything that is not
on your repo.
